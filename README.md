# C:/Documents/nil/sole/fey/run.exe
C:/Documents/nil/sole/fey/run.exe is a short and simple puzzle-maze game, with retro aesthetics and spooky vibes. As a player, you will not know where you are and what happened, only that there are keys to get and doors to unlock. Explore the maze with your phone's flashlight, and make sure the battery doesn't run out because it is dark! Made in Construct 2 during the Puerto Rico Online Game Jam 2019.
